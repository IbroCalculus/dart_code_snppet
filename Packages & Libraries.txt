NB: The website 'pub.dev' is the official package repository for Dart and Flutter apps.


import 'dart:math' as math;		//Built-in package. CHECK Math.txt

  var maxVal = math.max(34, 66);
  print("The maximum of both is: ${maxVal}");

  print("PI: ${math.pi}");



================== USING EXTERNAL LIBRARIES / DEPENDENCIIES =================
Create, if not exists, 'pubspec.yaml' file.
It is similar to mainfest file in android studio, we also add dependencies like within gradle file.

.yaml is a markup file where things are defined by spaces, rather than curly brackets as used in many programming languages.
